 A free & open-source 2D sprite editor, made with Godot Engine, using GDScript!

 [![Pixelorama's horrible UI](https://functionoverload590613498.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/screenshot_265.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8o8QKB8lPs)

Current features as of version v0.3:

- Choosing between 4 tools – pencil, eraser, fill bucket and rectangle select – and mapping them to both of your left and right mouse buttons. That’s, pretty wild, huh?
- Different colors and brush sizes for each of the mouse buttons.
- Custom brush support.
- Creating a new canvas with a size of your choosing.
- Are you an animator? Then you've come to the right place! Pixelorama has its own Animation Timeline just for you!​
- Importing PNG and JPEG images, and edit them inside Pixelorama. If you import multiple files, they will be added as individual animation frames.
- Export your gorgeous art as PNG files.
- Save snd open your projects as Pixelorama's custom file format, .pxo
- Tile Mode for pattern creation!
- Split screen mode to see your masterpiece twice!
- Create straight lines for pencil and eraser by holding down Shift while you draw.
- The middle mouse wheel isn’t forgotten, you can use it to pan around the canvas and by scrolling up and down, you can zoom in and out!
- Keyboard shortcuts! I’m pretty sure this is a lifesaver for most of you.
- Just like onions, Pixelorama has a multiple layer system! You can add, remove, move up and down, clone and merge as many layers as you like!
- Scale and crop your images!
