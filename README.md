# Pixelorama - your free and open-source sprite editor!
 A free & open-source 2D sprite editor, made with Godot Engine, using GDScript!

 Current features as of version v0.1:

- Choosing between 3 tools – pencil, eraser and fill bucket – and mapping them to both of your left and right mouse buttons. That’s, pretty wild, huh?
- Different colors for each of the mouse buttons.
- Creating a new canvas with a size of your choosing.
- Importing PNG and JPEG images, and edit them inside Pixelorama.
- Export your gorgeous art as PNG files.
- Create straight lines for pencil and eraser by holding down Shift while you draw.
- The middle mouse wheel isn’t forgotten, you can use it to pan around the canvas and by scrolling up and down, you can zoom in and out!
- Keyboard shortcuts! I’m pretty sure this is a lifesaver for most of you.
- Just like onions, Pixelorama has a multiple layer system! You can add, remove, move up and down, clone and merge as many layers as you like!
- It’s freeeeeee! And open source!
