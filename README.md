 Your free & open-source 2D sprite editor, made by Orama Interactive in the Godot Engine, using GDScript!

Current features as of version v0.4:

- Choosing between 6 tools – pencil, eraser, fill bucket, paint same color, lighten/darken and rectangle select – and mapping them to both of your left and right mouse buttons.
- Different colors and brush sizes for each of the mouse buttons.
- Support of two types of custom brushes: "From files" and "per project" brushes. Custom brushes from files get loaded from the "Brushes" folder that comes with Pixelorama, and per project brushes get saved with the rectangle select tool. 
- Creating a new canvas with a size of your choosing.
- Are you an animator? Then you've come to the right place! Pixelorama has its own Animation Timeline just for you!​
- Import images and edit them inside Pixelorama. If you import multiple files, they will be added as individual animation frames.
- Export your gorgeous art as PNG files.
- Save snd open your projects as Pixelorama's custom file format, .pxo
- Undo/Redo support!
- Horizontal & vertical mirrored drawing!
- Tile Mode for pattern creation!
- Split screen mode to see your masterpiece twice!
- Create straight lines for pencil and eraser by holding down Shift while you draw.
- The middle mouse wheel isn’t forgotten, you can use it to pan around the canvas and by scrolling up and down, you can zoom in and out!
- Keyboard shortcuts! I’m pretty sure this is a lifesaver for most of you.
- Just like onions, Pixelorama has a multiple layer system! You can add, remove, move up and down, clone and merge as many layers as you like! You can also rename them!
- Scale, crop and flip your images!
